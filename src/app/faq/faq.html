            <h3>What type of power outlets does Taniti use?</h3>
            <p>
                Power outlets are 120 volts, the same as in the United States.
                You won't need any special adapters if you're traveling from the
                US.

            <h3>What currency is used on Taniti?</h3>
            <p>
                Taniti uses the U.S. dollar as its primary currency. Many
                businesses also accept euros and yen. Several banks facilitate
                currency exchange, and most businesses accept major credit

            <p>
                Many younger Tanitians speak fluent English, especially in
                tourist areas. However, very little English is spoken in rural
                areas, particularly by older residents. Learning a few basic
                local phrases can be helpful for exploring remote areas.
